# Comprehensive Examinations
Students in the Department of Mathematics fulfill the traditional role of an oral candidacy examination by the successful completion of one comprehensive examination in either algebra or analysis, with specialized topics according to their request. Students are strongly advised to read the [regulations](https://github.com/umanitoba-math/grad-studies/blob/main/comprehensive-exams/compexam2022_Oct.pdf). Although students should have absolutely no expectations that future examinations are identical or even remotely similar to any particular previous examination, we include links here to the following previous examinations in [algebra](https://github.com/umanitoba-math/grad-studies/tree/main/comprehensive-exams/algebra) and in [analysis](https://github.com/umanitoba-math/grad-studies/tree/main/comprehensive-exams/analysis) in case they are found to be helpful.
